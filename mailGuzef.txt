Greetings,

We are writing you this email in order to ask for some clarifications about your work with the following DOI:
https://doi.org/10.3390/sym13101760.

We are students from Politecnico di Milano and our major is Biomedical Engineering and we're working on a thesis about individuating a model in order to describe tumoral cell growth alterations in presence of cytotoxic drugs.
We found your article on Scopus and as it is right now, we are validating the results with the intention of predicting the effect of other types of drugs.

We tried to replicate your results with Python and had the following issues while validating the model over 312 hours:
- with an initial cell population set to 5e4 our graphs were similar, but diverged when the graph started going down;
- on the other hand, with A(0) set to 1e4 and 1e4 the maximum mumber of cells/mL didn't go down and died faster than expected.

We used the same values as Table 1 in the papaer (with Ad(0)=2500), then proceeded to solve the ODE with the RK45 method and a maximum step of 1 out of 1 million intervals (see attachment). 
Successively, we did a sensibility test on the model, and found out that it was probably an incorrect parameter or two that caused the issue. Even though we don't know which.

We would ask you to help with the following:
- identifying the faulty parameter;
- understanding how the cytotoxic rate in presence of the drug was found

We are looking foward to hearing from you,
Chang Hui Simone Lin,
Elena Sabatino,
Martina Toselli.
